I prefer the sharing collaborative features rather than the AI / quiz features, which are available in many products already - rich8
- [Original Prototype](http://openk.net/dokuwiki/doku.php) Built using Dokuwiki and Slidy (May/June 2013) I might package this up into github... as it IS the version currently being used by students
- See README2 for installation instructions
